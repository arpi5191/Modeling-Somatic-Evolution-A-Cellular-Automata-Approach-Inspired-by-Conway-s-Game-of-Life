# Modeling Somatic Evolution: A Cellular Automata Approach Inspired by Conway's Game of Life
## Introduction
To be added
## Instructions
1. Run "GoL.ipynb" in a code editor like Jupyter Notebook to perform the following tasks:
   - Initialize and save the board to a file.
   - Run the simulation to generate the boards, draw the image and GIF, and graph the live cell count over the generations, following the original Game of Life rules.
   - Run the simulation to generate graphs of mutation magnitude versus various metrics, as well as line graphs and lattice maps of the live cell population over generations, following the modified Game of Life rules with the following
     mutations: steady-state generation, end population, lonely threshold, born threshold, and crowded threshold.
